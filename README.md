  <strong>Teslasynth</strong>
  <i>(MIDI synthesizer for interrupted devices)</i>
</p>


This is a complete MIDI synthesizer, that uses pulse width modulation(PWM) to play music through any interrupted device, including Tesla coils, Flyback transformers, High power lasers, or basically any device that can make noise when powered on.

To be documented soon...
